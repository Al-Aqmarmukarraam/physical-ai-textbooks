# Anatomy of a Humanoid Robot

## Introduction

Humanoid robots are designed to mimic human form and function, featuring similar structural components and degrees of freedom. Understanding their anatomy is crucial for developing effective control systems and applications.

## Core Concept

The key components of a humanoid robot include:

- **Torso**: Central body structure housing main computers, power systems, and core sensors
- **Head**: Contains cameras, microphones, and sometimes LiDAR for perception
- **Arms**: Typically 7-DOF per arm to provide human-like manipulation capabilities
- **Hands**: Complex end-effectors with multiple fingers and joints for dexterous manipulation
- **Legs**: Designed for bipedal locomotion with hip, knee, and ankle joints
- **Joints**: Actuated connections between body segments with specific ranges of motion
- **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: Independent parameters defining the configuration of the robot

Humanoid robots typically have 20-50+ degrees of freedom, allowing for complex movements and interactions.

## Example

A typical humanoid robot like NAO has:
- 25 degrees of freedom
- 6 DOF in each leg (hip pitch, hip roll, hip yaw, knee pitch, ankle pitch, ankle roll)
- 6 DOF in each arm (shoulder pitch, shoulder roll, elbow yaw, elbow roll, wrist yaw, hand)
- 2 DOF in the head (pitch and yaw)

## Key Takeaway

- Humanoid robots have similar structural components to humans: torso, head, arms, legs
- Degrees of freedom determine the robot's movement capabilities
- More DOF provides greater flexibility but increases control complexity
