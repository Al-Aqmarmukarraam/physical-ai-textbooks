# Core Components of a Physical AI System

## Introduction

A Physical AI system comprises multiple interconnected components that work together to enable intelligent behavior in the physical world. Understanding these components is essential for designing effective robotic systems.

## Core Concept

The primary components of a Physical AI system include:

- **Sensors**: Devices that perceive the environment (cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, force/torque sensors)
- **Actuators**: Components that enable physical interaction (motors, servos, pneumatic systems)
- **Control Systems**: Algorithms that process sensor data and generate actuator commands
- **AI Models**: Learning systems that enable adaptive and intelligent behavior
- **Computational Hardware**: Processors capable of running real-time AI algorithms
- **Power Systems**: Energy sources and management for sustained operation

These components must be carefully integrated to achieve coherent behavior while respecting physical constraints and real-time requirements.

## Example

Consider a mobile manipulation robot:
- **Sensors**: RGB-D camera for vision, IMU for orientation, force sensors in gripper
- **Actuators**: Wheel motors for locomotion, joint motors for arm movement, gripper actuator
- **Control Systems**: Path planning algorithms, motion controllers, grasp controllers
- **AI Models**: Object recognition networks, manipulation policy networks, navigation systems

## Key Takeaway

- Physical AI systems require integration of sensing, actuation, control, and intelligence
- Each component must be selected and designed to work within the system constraints
- The interaction between components determines overall system performance and capabilities
