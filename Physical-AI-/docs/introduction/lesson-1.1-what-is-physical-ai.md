# What is Physical AI?

## Introduction

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional software-based artificial intelligence to systems that interact directly with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that processes data in virtual environments, Physical AI encompasses intelligent systems that perceive, reason, and act in three-dimensional space with real-world constraints.

## Core Concept

Physical AI combines several key elements:

- **Embodied Cognition**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **Real-time Processing**: The ability to process sensor data and generate responses within strict time constraints
- **Physical Constraints**: Operating within the laws of physics, including considerations for mass, friction, and energy
- **Multi-modal Sensing**: Integration of various sensor types including vision, touch, and proprioception

Physical AI systems must handle uncertainty inherent in physical interactions, adapt to dynamic environments, and maintain safety while achieving their objectives. This contrasts with traditional AI systems that operate in controlled, digital environments with deterministic outcomes.

## Example

Consider an autonomous delivery robot navigating through a busy pedestrian area. The robot must simultaneously process visual data to identify obstacles, use tactile sensors to detect contact with objects, maintain balance using inertial measurement units, and make split-second decisions to avoid collisions. Each of these capabilities must work in harmony within the constraints of battery life, processing power, and safety requirements.

## Key Takeaway

- Physical AI extends traditional AI by incorporating real-world interaction and physical constraints
- These systems must handle uncertainty, adapt to dynamic environments, and maintain safety
- Physical AI requires integration of multiple sensor modalities and real-time decision making
